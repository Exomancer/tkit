<p>(T)opology Kit</p>
<p>Adds a few operators for selection manipulation in edge mode, most of which are more easily understood by experience than by description.</p>
<p>A good medium for observation and testing is a subdivided mesh, IN EDGE MODE, with a few stray edges selected.</p>
<p>Quote:  Deselect edges at the "edge" of the selection.</p>
<p>Shift + Quote:  Deselect edges on the "inside" of the selection.</p>
<p>Left Bracket:  Un-Extend the edge selection by deselecting the "tips".</p>
<p>Right Bracket:  Extend the edge selection.</p>
<p>Backslash:  Select edges that are topologically "perpendicular" to the selected edges.</p>
<p>Shift+Backslash: A variation of the preceding.</p>
<p>Control + Shift + Backslash: Another Variation.</p>
<p>Control + Shift + Alt + Backslash: Another Variation.</p>
<p>Control + Alt + Shift + End:  Selects edges at the "tips".</p>
